abstract = {The vast and diverse data generated from recent large-scale genomic projects have no precedent. For optimal use, these data have been compiled and organized in different kinds of Molecular Biology Databases (MBDBs). These MBDBs include information on genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, interactomics, and metabolomics among many others. MBDBs have become an essential part of everyday scientific activity, making possible the identification of relationships to a specific biological problem and assisting the scientist to guide their research. This article will describe some of the most relevant MBDBs in the microbiology field. The fundamental concepts required to understand the basic principles of each kind of MBDB, the internet servers, and their associated analysis software is discussed. Practical ideas of how to perform database searches, considering their main relationships, are also presented.},

@book{Prjibelski2018,
abstract = {Nucleic acids and proteins are key macromolecules responsible for the correct functioning of every single living organism. These molecules are biopolymers, characterized by their primary structure, which is determined by sequencing methods. This primary structure encodes clues to understanding how the nucleic acids and proteins function. Deoxyribonucleotide (DNA) and ribonucleotide (RNA) are made up of nucleotide monomers, while proteins are polymers of amino acids. DNA provides instructions for building a protein, RNA serves as a messenger between the DNA and the protein, and proteins in turn are responsible for carrying out nearly every task in an organism's life. The analysis of nucleotide and protein sequence data is a complicated task, requiring comprehensive bioinformatics approaches, sophisticated computational tools and smart databases.},

@article{Land2015,
abstract = {Since the first two complete bacterial genome sequences were published in 1995, the science of bacteria has dramatically changed. Using third-generation DNA sequencing, it is possible to completely sequence a bacterial genome in a few hours and identify some types of methylation sites along the genome as well. Sequencing of bacterial genome sequences is now a standard procedure, and the information from tens of thousands of bacterial genomes has had a major impact on our views of the bacterial world. In this review, we explore a series of questions to highlight some insights that comparative genomics has produced. To date, there are genome sequences available from 50 different bacterial phyla and 11 different archaeal phyla. However, the distribution is quite skewed towards a few phyla that contain model organisms. But the breadth is continuing to improve, with projects dedicated to filling in less characterized taxonomic groups. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas system provides bacteria with immunity against viruses, which outnumber bacteria by tenfold. How fast can we go? Second-generation sequencing has produced a large number of draft genomes (close to 90 {\%} of bacterial genomes in GenBank are currently not complete); third-generation sequencing can potentially produce a finished genome in a few hours, and at the same time provide methlylation sites along the entire chromosome. The diversity of bacterial communities is extensive as is evident from the genome sequences available from 50 different bacterial phyla and 11 different archaeal phyla. Genome sequencing can help in classifying an organism, and in the case where multiple genomes of the same species are available, it is possible to calculate the pan- and core genomes; comparison of more than 2000 Escherichia coli genomes finds an E. coli core genome of about 3100 gene families and a total of about 89,000 different gene families. Why do we care about bacterial genome sequencing? There are many practical applications, such as genome-scale metabolic modeling, biosurveillance, bioforensics, and infectious disease epidemiology. In the near future, high-throughput sequencing of patient metagenomic samples could revolutionize medicine in terms of speed and accuracy of finding pathogens and knowing how to treat them.},

Each section describes about the genome of a specific group of organisms, such as viruses, archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes and organellar genomes. Individual chapters provide details of their organization, structure, evolution, sequencing strategies and functions. Further, this book discusses the technologies that are applied for genome sequencing; assembly, annotation and gene prediction. Other topics include the genomes of important model organisms, mitochondria genome of Neanderthal fossil, etc. This book also examines the evolution of chloroplast and mitochondria genomes by comparing with bacteria, addresses the diseases that occur in humans due to the mutations in mitochondrial genome, gene therapy and engineering of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. Lastly, it features an overview of the role of proteomics, exposomics, connectomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics. This book is a fascinating read for students, lecturers and researchers in the field of genetics, genomics, microbiology and life sciences.},
