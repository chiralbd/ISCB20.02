This report is created by\href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/jubayer28/}{Jubayer Hossain} using \LaTeX. \LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. \LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. I would like to mention some sources of learning \LaTeX for the rising writers.
